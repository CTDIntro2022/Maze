This javascript code is a translatin and ehancement of the Python code for Harvard X class "CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python". That code is included in this repo but can be found also in this repo: https://github.com/goodboychan/edx/blob/master/Harvard-CS50AI/Search/src0/maze.py. 
To run:
1) Open the grid.html file
2) Choose a text file which represents a grid. Several are provided in the sub folder "Maze Text Definitions"
3) Assuming the definition is valid you may choose which search algorithm to use, the default is depth-first search
4) Either Step through or Solve the entire maze. You may Solve at any time.
5) If a solution is found you will be told the number of states explored and number in the solution (the path from start to goal)
6) Color coding:
7)   - Dark Green: Start
     - Red: Goal
     - Dark Blue: explored
     - Light Blue: Frontier, to be explored
     - Light Green: Solution
